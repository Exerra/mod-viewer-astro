# Exerra's mods viewer

This is the 2nd version of my mods website, featuring a very Material You-inspired design alongside an orange colour scheme.

## Project stack

The website framework is Astro, which is a static site builder (& almost a meta-framework) that generates ridiculously small JS (or even in a lot of cases, none).

The CSS framework is TailwindCSS. It is basically CSS but in HTML clases.

Website can be deployed on any hosting provider that has support for a build step & output directory, but the master branch is hosted on Cloudflare Pages and any other branches on Vercel.
